# First, I initialize my set values that will help with the while loop
total = 0  # To store the sum of the numbers
z = 0  # Counter variable, not used in this version, can be removed
x = 0  # Index for the list

# Initialize the list to store the numbers
arrlist = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # List to store 5 numbers

# Nest my while loop that will take inputs and add them to the list and add them to the total sum
while x < 5:
    print("Enter a number:")
    arrlist[x] = int(input())  # Take input and store it in the list at index x
    total += arrlist[x]  # Add the entered number to the total sum
    x += 1  # Move to the next index
    z += 1  # Increment z, though it's not being used for anything

# After the loop, take the total and divide it by 5 to get the average
average = total / 5  # Calculate the average
print(f"{average} is the average of the given numbers")  # Print the average
